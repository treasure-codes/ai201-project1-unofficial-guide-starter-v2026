# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
The corpus is short and factual; most usable answers sit in a single sentence, so
I expect the retrieval layer to surface at least one matching chunk on most of my
questions. One hard question is acceptable because a few documents mention the same
rule in different ways.

---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
This setup is built around student advice, so source attribution is the difference
between "helpful" and "grounded." In this corpus, every answer should be tied back
to a document because the documents themselves are the authority.

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
The cutoff is meant to separate in-corpus questions from unrelated ones. I chose
4 of 5 because the gate should be strict for clearly off-topic questions even if
one borderline case is close enough to deserve inspection.

---

## 4. Chunks are complete enough to stand alone

At least 4 of 5 sampled chunks read as a complete thought, with no sentence split
in the middle and no heading or fragment left behind.

**Why this target:**
The campus-life documents are short, so a good chunk should usually be a self-
contained answer rather than half of a sentence. This is an observable review
criterion: a person can look at the chunk and decide whether it holds a usable
fact without needing its neighbors.

---

## 5. The system answers from the retrieved evidence rather than guessing

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the answer uses the source text and not a
generalized guess from the model's training data.

**Why this target:**
The assignment is specifically about grounded answers, so the core quality check is
whether the response stays tied to the documents. A model can sound confident and
still be wrong, so I want the answer to be supported by the retrieved evidence on
most of the questions I care about.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
